# Real-Time Communications Labs

A collection of labs and tutorials for Real-Time Communications.

## Current labs

I'm just getting started with this, so there's only one lab at the moment. I'll be adding more soon.

- [WebRTC Network with SIP.js and routr](webrtc-sipjs-routr/README.md)

## Support my work

The best way to support me is by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/psanders) or by getting a copy of my book [The future of programmable SIP servers](https://fonoster.gumroad.com/l/the-future-of-programmable-sip-servers).

This handbook offers a detailed information about of the innovative features, challenges, and opportunities associated with using Routr.
