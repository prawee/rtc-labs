# Real-Time Communications Labs

A collection of labs and tutorials for Real-Time Communications.

## Labs

I'm just getting started with this, so there's only one lab at the moment. 

I'll be adding more soon.

- [WebRTC Network with SIP.js and routr](webrtc_network_with_sipjs_and_routr)

## Support my work

The best way to support me is by becoming a sponsor or by getting a copy of my book [The future of programmable SIP servers](https://fonoster.gumroad.com/l/the-future-of-programmable-sip-servers).

This handbook offers a detailed information about of the innovative features, challenges, and opportunities associated with using Routr.
